Hi. I'm a PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Seoul National University advised by <a href="https://me.snu.ac.kr/node/112" target="_blank">Prof. Hyungmin Park</a>. 

I'm studying fluid mechanics in <a href="https://mffv.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Multiphase Flow and Flow Visualization Lab</a>.

Currently, I am interested in applying deep learning to help clarify complex flow phenomena.
